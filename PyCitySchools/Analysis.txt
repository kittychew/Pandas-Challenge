Spending ranges per Student:
The relationship between spending per student and academic performance reveals an unexpected trend. Schools with lower spending per student tend to achieve higher average scores and better passing rates. For instance, schools in the <$585 spending range show an higher average for reading (96.61%) and math (93.46%) and passing rate (90.36%), while schools spending between $645 and $680 per student have lower average reading (81.13%) and math (66.16%) scores and passing rates (53.52%). This inverse relationship suggests that increased spending does not necessarily equate to better academic outcomes and raises questions about the efficiency of resource allocation. The data implies that factors other than spending, such as instructional quality and administrative practices, might play a more significant role in driving student achievement.

School Size: 
The analysis indicates a notable difference in academic performance based on school size. Smaller schools, with fewer than 1,000 students, and medium-sized schools, accommodating between 1,000 and 2,000 students, generally exhibit higher average math scores compared to their larger counterparts. Specifically, smaller schools have an average math score of approximately 83.82, while medium-sized schools score around 83.37. In reading, medium-sized schools perform slightly better than both small and large schools, with an average reading score of about 83.86. This pattern suggests that smaller and medium-sized schools may offer more personalized instruction or support, potentially contributing to better student outcomes in these subjects. The data implies that these schools might be more agile and capable of addressing individual student needs effectively.

School Type: 
Charter schools consistently outperform district schools across various performance metrics. Charter schools exhibit higher average math scores (around 83.47 vs. 76.96) and reading scores (approximately 83.90 vs. 80.97), along with superior passing rates. For instance, charter schools have an overall passing rate of 90.43%, compared to 53.67% for district schools. This suggests that charter schools might benefit from more effective academic programs, innovative teaching methods, or better resource allocation compared to district schools. The pronounced disparity in performance highlights the potential advantages of charter school models in providing high-quality education.
